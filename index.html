      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>Once a mudbrick waystation along desert trading routes, Riyadh is now one of the wealthiest cities in the world. The country’s political, financial and administrative capital is also a city with a fascinating subtext.</p>
      
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>Riyadh (/rɨˈjɑːd/; Arabic: الرياض‎ ar-Riyāḍ pronounced [arːiˈjɑːdˤ],"The Gardens") is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia. It is also the capital of Riyadh Province, and belongs to the historical regions of Najd and Al-Yamama. It is situated in the center of the Arabian Peninsula on a large plateau, and is home to 5,254,560 people, and the urban center of a region with a population of close to 7 million people.</p>

      <p>The city is divided into 15 municipal districts, managed by Riyadh Municipality headed by the mayor of Riyadh, and the Riyadh Development Authority, chaired by the governor of Riyadh Province, Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud. The current mayor of Riyadh is Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman Al Mogbel, appointed in 2012. Riyadh has the largest all female university in the world, the Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University. It has been designated as a Beta World City.</p>

      <h3>Religion and Oppression of Women (and others)</h3>
      <p>In Riyadh, like in all of Saudi Arabia, the government religion is a fundamentalist version of Islam called Wahhabism (although its adherents prefer "Salafiyya"). It preaches the inferiority of women, the moral imperative to do violence against other Muslims and against non-Muslims, and the sinfulness of non-straight sexualities. However, Saudi Arabia wants tourism dollars, so they keep both this and all the slave labor and terrorist funding on the down-low and instead will dazzle you with all their legitimately cool technology. Riyadh has the largest all-female university in the world because Wahhabism forbids coed learning. Fun fact: women require the permission of a male guardian in order to attend university. Women also require written permission from a male guardian in order to fly - Saudi Arabian women get this checked by airport security along with their ID and ticket. In fact, women are so segregated from "normal" (male) society that they weren't even allowed to drive until 2018. All in all, it is kind of a weird choice on the part of a school that prides themselves on non-discrimination to have a fun, whitewashed blurb about this particular capitol city.</p>
